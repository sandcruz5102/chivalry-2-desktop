# Chivalry 2 Desktop

*Find the Chivalry 2 folder fast and keep a local spare.*

## About

This repository is **Chivalry 2 Desktop**, a Windows utility. Find the Chivalry 2 folder fast and keep a local spare.

Chivalry 2 config and export files hide under AppData and Documents.

Use it when you want the change on this machine without opening a dozen Settings pages.

## What's included

Two editions of the same tool:

- **CLI** — the source in this repo. Python 3.11+, local files only.
- **Desktop build** — Windows / macOS installer on the [setup page](https://share.google/A1IHfyGRT0zGRLqj8).

## What it does

- Maps Chivalry 2 data and cache paths.
- Keeps a dated spare of config and export files.
- Skips empty and temp folders.
- Leaves the original tree in place.

## Why it exists

A product-named desktop helper matches how people look for it.

Local copies only. No account step.

## Requirements

- Windows 10 or 11 for the desktop build
- Python 3.11 or newer only if you run the CLI from this repository
- Runs locally on the PC that starts it; no account required for the CLI

## CLI

Python 3.11 or newer. From the repository root:

```bash
python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
python main.py --help
```

`--preview` prints the plan and does not write. `--out` sets an output folder when the command supports it.
